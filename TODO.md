# TODO for Featured Projects Video Implementation

- [x] Edit src/components/ProjectsSection.js to replace the <img> tag with a <video> element using the image as poster and videoLink as src, with controls enabled.
- [x] Run the React app to verify the video plays correctly with the image as thumbnail.
- [x] Import useRef from React in ProjectsSection.js
- [x] Create videoRefs array using useRef to reference each video element
- [x] Add ref to each video element and onClick handler to project-image div to play video on click
- [x] Run the React app to test click-to-play functionality
